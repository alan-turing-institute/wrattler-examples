# wrattler-examples
Easy-to-setup local deployment of the Wrattler notebook, using pre-built docker images pulled from dockerhub. 

To build and run (assuming you have Docker and docker-compose installed);
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
And you should be able to access Wrattler by pointing your browswer to ```localhost:8080```.
